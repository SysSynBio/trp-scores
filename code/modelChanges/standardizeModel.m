% model = standardizeModel(model,toolbox)
% Standardize a yeast GEM model to include some RAVEN fields.
%
% INPUT:    A yeast model as a .mat structure and the toolbox name
%           used to create said model ('RAVEN' or 'COBRA').
% OUTPUT:   The standardized model. Main corrections applied are:
%           *Removal of any compartment reference in MetNames
%           *Addition of the comps vector (if not present)
%           *Addition of the compNames vector (if not present)
%           *Addition of the metComps vector (if not present)
